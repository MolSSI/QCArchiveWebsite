The Quantum Chemistry Archive makes its debut at the American Chemical Society's annual meeting in Spring of 2019.

Entering open beta, and presented to the broader quantum chemistry community, the talk for QCArchive   
will cover three of its primary use cases:

1. Retrieving and exploring existing, large quantum chemistry data sets with ease
2. Calculating and organizing the data needed to create the parameters for a bespoke force field for molecular mechanics
3. Democratizing AI data generation by enabling easy submission of new calculations

The talk is scheduled for Wednesday, April 3 at 10:40 AM in the 
__[Valencia Ballroom B-D - Theater 7, Orange County Convention Center](https://plan.core-apps.com/acsorlando2019/place/e6f24cce699c743a97bdd6ed31d8cfcd?booth=76b3edca749516ae86e34075e108fc86).__
