Part of the QCArchive team went to SciPy this year to find out about the latest
scientific and data analysis python projects. SciPy brings together hundreds of
members of the scientific python community from academia, government, and
industry partners; you can find more details
**[here](https://www.scipy2019.scipy.org)**. Attending SciPy for us is a
fantastic opportunity to interact with leaders in the field and to find out
where the SciPy ecosystem is evolving over the next year.

First and foremost, we gave a talk with MolSSI Associate Lori Burns, a research
software engineering at Georgia Tech, who is working with us on the QCArchive
project.  This talk covers how QCArchive is making the quantum chemistry
ecosystem more composable by breaking down common operations into building
blocks and exploring ways to interact with the SciPy ecosystem. We also briefly
covered some of the capabilities of the QCArchive ecosystem and projects that
use this ecosystem.

It was fantastic to see friends that are part of many academic groups,
communities, and companies such as the MOSDEF initiative, Glotzer Group,
Cummings Group, Relay Therapeutics, IBM-Q, Exxon, Numat Technologies, NAMD,
[Psi4](https://github.com/psi4/psi4),
[MDAnalysis](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis), and more! We believe
the presence of these groups highlights the importance of the Scientific Python
ecosystem in computational molecular science. A few open-source highlights from
the above group:

 - **[MOSDEF-Hub](https://github.com/mosdef-hub)** - MD Workflows, atom types, and molecule builders.
 - **[Freud](https://github.com/glotzerlab/freud)** - Mesoscale particle trajectory analysis tools.

If you could not attend SciPy you can check out all of the presentations on
YouTube! See the full list
**[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GcDQblpQ_M1V3PQPoLWiDAC)**.
In particular, check out a few presentations that we particularly enjoyed:
