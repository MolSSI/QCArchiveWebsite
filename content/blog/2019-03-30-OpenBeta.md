Today the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) is pleased to announce
the Quantum Chemistry Archive (QCArchive) ecosystem’s open beta. This ecosystem
focuses on sharing, computing, and analyzing complex quantum chemistry data for
new methodology assessment, force field creation, training of AI models, and
more. 

At MolSSI, the support of the greater computational molecular sciences
community is core to our mission and future directions. As such, this open beta
does not represent a complete product; however, this beta does demonstrate our
core functionality and gives us a platform to build upon. Your feedback and
ideas are crucial to which future directions we explore— if you have comments
or ideas, please get in touch at **[qcarchive@molssi.org](mailto:qcarchive@molssi.org)**.

-------------

Our current plans over the next several months to improve the ecosystem are
as follows:

- Creation of a web front-end to explore our datasets without requiring Jupyter
Notebooks.

- Increase the amount of visualization and statistics provided out-of-the-box
to QCArchive data. This includes 2D and 3D molecular visualization through
pre-existing open-source libraries.

- Find new partners to develop new kinds of high-level Collections. These
collections are high level workflows or datasets that are commonly found within
the computational molecular sciences.

Please explore our website for examples and additional overview information to
obtain an idea of the capabilities of the QCArchive ecosystem. Feel free to
join our

**[send us a e-mail](mailto:qcarchive@molssi.org)**, or if you are at the
National ACS Orlando meeting find us at the MolSSI symposium on Sustainable
Software (Valencia Ballroom, Theater 7)!

We hope you find this project useful and will consider working with us to help
us evolve the project to provide a central data repository for the
computational molecular sciences community.

Sincerely,

**The QCArchive Developers**
