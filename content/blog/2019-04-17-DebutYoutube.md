A YouTube version of QCArchive's ACS 2019 talk is now available on the MolSSI YouTube channel!

The talk at ACS was a rousing success and we wanted to thank everyone who attended. For those that missed it, or if you 
want to see the talk again, we have uploaded a re-recording of the talk to MolSSI's YouTube account. Check it out
