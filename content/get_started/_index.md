description: "Getting Started with QCArchive"
pageDescription : "The Quantum Chemistry Archive aims to provide an open, community-wide quantum chemistry database to both facilitate and capture hundreds of millions of hours of computing time to enable large-scale forcefield construction, physical property prediction, new methodology assessment, and machine learning from data that would otherwise end up siloed or inaccessible.

The QCArchive offers FAIR access to millions of computational molecular science results in a highly structured and perfomant manner. 
These include curated interaction energy, thermochemical, and conformational datasets from the literature;
data from partner groups; 
and data donated to or computed by MolSSI.
You are also welcome to submit your own data.

We are currently working hard on our web front-end for the MolSSI QCArchive
database, check back in soon for this functionality!"
