      content : "### Our Pledge

                 In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
                 contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
                 our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
                 body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
                 experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
                 identity and orientation.

                 ### Our Standards

                 Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

                 * Using welcoming and inclusive language
                 * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
                 * Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
                 * Focusing on what is best for the community
                 * Showing empathy towards other community members

                 Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

                 * The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
                 * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
                 * Public or private harassment
                 * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
                 * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

                 ### Our Responsibilities

                 Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
                 behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
                 response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

                 Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
                 reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
                 that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
                 permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
                 threatening, offensive, or harmful.

                 Moreover, project maintainers will strive to offer feedback and advice to
                 ensure quality and consistency of contributions to the code.  Contributions
                 from outside the group of project maintainers are strongly welcomed but the
                 final decision as to whether commits are merged into the codebase rests with
                 the team of project maintainers.

                 ### Scope

                 This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
                 when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
                 representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
                 address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
                 appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a
                 project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

                 ### Enforcement

                 Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
                 reported by contacting the project team at molssi@vt.edu. The project team will
                 review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems
                 appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain
                 confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of
                 specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

                 Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
                 faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
                 members of the project's leadership.
