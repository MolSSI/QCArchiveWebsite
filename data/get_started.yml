software, but as several modules that form an ecosystem.  This provides many
libraries that can be used independently. Whether you want physical constants
and molecule parsing with QCElemental, a quantum chemistry program agnostic
executor with QCEngine, or the run your own QCFractal instance all software is
open to the community.

supplying compute time or data. If you are interested
in additional methods for a given dataset get in touch! Also, if you have a
well-structured dataset that is not within our database already, we accept
contributions. This process is currently in beta, and we are actively looking
to work with additional groups.

This elasticity allows for easy development and the ability to explore
capabilities on laptops while still retaining the ability to scale. We currently
support Optimization, GridOptimization, and TorsionDrive pipelines. Extra capabilities
can be quickly added to the stack, get in touch or check out the code!
