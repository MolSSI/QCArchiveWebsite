  title : "View data with QCPortal"
  content : "
QCPortal is the Python front-end for analyzing and visualizing results.
QCPortal contains many types of <i>Collections</i> that organize large amounts
of data in canonical ways such as a <i>ReactionDataset</i> which contains many
common interaction energy, thermochemical, and conformational datasets from the
literature.

    title: "Using the QCArchive ecosystem"
    content: "The QCArchive ecosystem was created not as a monolithic piece of
software, but as several modules that form an ecosystem.  This provides many
libraries that can be used independently. Whether you want physical constants
and molecule parsing with QCElemental, a quantum chemistry program agnostic
executor with QCEngine, or the run your own QCFractal instance all software is
open to the community.

    content : "The community can extend the MolSSI QCArchive database by
supplying additional compute time to this central queue. If you are interested
in additional methods for a given dataset get in touch! Also, if you have a
well-structured dataset that is not within our database already, we accept
contributions. This process is currently in beta, and we are actively looking
to work with additional groups.

Molecular Sciences Software Institute. In addition to our open-source
commitments, paid support for custom QCFractal instances, code, consulting, and
priority support is available. For academic projects, consider writing us into
your next grant for priority support and training.  Contact us for additional

    title: "Execute Complex Pipelines"
    content: "QCFractal can execute a single pipeline or thousands of pipeline
(workflow) operations simultaneously on a laptop or a dozen supercomputers.
This elasticity allows for easy development and the ability to explore
capabilities on laptops while still retaining the ability to scale. We currently
support Optimization, GridOptimization, and TorsionDrive pipelines. Extra capabilities
can be quickly added to the stack, get in touch or check out the code!
