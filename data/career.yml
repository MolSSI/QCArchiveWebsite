# LNN: I had to make a unique layouts/projects.html from a copy of the theme one because
# the theme one was a literal forum for contact and applying, it was not usable for our
# purposes, so I re-worked it. The YAML is now a bit confusing and can be cleaned up later,
# but it works.

      details : "Provides the primary interface to the data base with the stored calculation results.
                 QC Portal clients connect to the Fractal Server and request calculations, or add new
                 constructs such as data sets or molecules before requesting calculations. Fractal then
                 creates a flat job list which distribution Managers can pull from and send to compute
                 hardware. All job connectivity logic is handled through Fractal, so any number of managers
                 connected to any number of compute backends can handle jobs."
