  title : "Manage quantum chemistry computations at scale"
  content : "<q><i>I'd like to do machine learning on dataset X from a single
line.</q></i><br><br> <q><i>I want to generate bespoke parameters for a new
drug from an existing database.</q></i><br><br>  <q><i>Which DFT method gives
the best results for my set of reactions?</q></i><br><br>

  These are some of the use cases we at MolSSI heard from the quantum chemistry
community when evaluating how best to serve this area. The emerging trend we
saw was a need to have a regular structure of quantum chemistry results, the
ability to access them on-demand without downloading several GB of data and run
new calculations if need be ideally without repeating what someone has already
done. To meet these goals, the QCArchive project was started to unite this
otherwise isolated data which may only have been shared previously though
massive, non-regular files; or through publications and supplementary material.
Funded by the NSF, MolSSI seeks to provide solutions to these, and other
use-cases in the quantum chemistry field through the QCArchive project. "

  title : "The QCArchive is an Open-Source Ecosystem"
  content : " The QCA project is designed from the start to be open-source and
available to the computational molecular sciences community. The entire code
base is public through GitHub repositories, and we are contributing back to
other Open Source projects as good members of the community. Rather than a
monolithic piece of software, the QCArchive software ecosystem is decomposed
into several components so that it can be used as a full ecosystem to build on
top of or in support of community software. See a full list of software
components <a href=/projects/>here</a>."
